# nBTC

`nBTC` is the synthetic Bitcoin on Sui, redeemable 1-1 for BTC.

It's the first ever synthetic BTC (BTC that is represented on other chain) that is

- fully permissionless,
- custodyless,
- rightmost trust minimized (read about [nBTC trust model](https://x.com/goNativeCC/status/1899487861939806641))
- keeps the true Web3 ethos.

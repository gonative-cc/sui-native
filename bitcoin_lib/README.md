## Overview

This repository contains a set of primitive components for on-chain Bitcoin operations:

- [Bitcoin Executor](./sources/executor/) - A Bitcoin simulator written in Sui Move. This inspired from Kostas May Hackathon. More details [bitcoin_executor.md](./docs/bitcoin_executor.md).

- [Bitcoin Parser](./sources/bitcoin_parser) - A low-level, foundational utility for parsing and deserializing raw Bitcoin data structures. It handles block headers, transactions, inputs, outputs, and witness data, providing the essential building blocks for the applications.
